- **Search and Filter:** A search function allows users to filter reported items based on categories, dates, and locations.
- **Notifications:** Users receive alerts when there is a match between lost and found items.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system using Firebase Authentication.
- **Real-time Database:** Firebase Firestore for storing and managing reports efficiently.
